</table><br>In short 
my hobbies are cooking and internet. I read, watch, memorize and learn from the Internet. In short, I spend most of my free time in front of the computer.  Because my profession is in this field. This is how I like to project. But it's a bit difficult for now because I'm learning. I love cooking. Sometimes I enjoy cooking different kinds of food, but most of the time I don't have time to cook.
<strong><ul><li class="g3">Likes and Dislikes:</li></ul></strong>
There are many things in our life that I like and dislike. I like things to be good. Being happy is one way to be wise. I like to read because knowledge is sometimes useful. I love reading because it gives not only knowledge but also wonderful moments of joy and pleasure.
I don't want my loved ones to get involved with other people.
I'm jealous even though I know it's wrong. <br>
 <br>
And of course I love music! I like to do all my work while listening to music.


<h4>Finally, the things I hope to achieve in my life are: Have a very successful career, so after college I try to get into university  and make it all on my own.</h4>
